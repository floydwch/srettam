This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, build the app:

```bash
yarn run build
```

Then, start the server:

```bash
yarn run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/posts](http://localhost:3000/posts) with your browser to see the result.

## What Are Implemented

- full features and bonus
- ssr
- a simple data repository

## What Are Not Perfect

- ui
- typing
- env
- commit logs

## Noted

- the pagination occurs when there are more than 3 posts.
- the orbitdb seems to lack the capability to perform advanced query, the implementation of pagination is thus underperforming.
